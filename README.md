<h1>PATTERNS DESIGNING</h1>

 <h2>Description of the Application</h2>
  <p>This application implements examples of some application templates. A simplified abstract logic of class 
implementation is used to demonstrate the general architecture of programs.</p>

  <p>The following categories of templates are implemented here:</p>

 <ul>

  <h3>Creational Design Patterns:</h3>

   <li>
<p><b>Builder:</b> is a generative design pattern that allows you to create complex objects step by step. 
The builder makes it possible to use the same building code to obtain different representations of objects.
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
<p><b>Factory:</b> is a generative design pattern that defines a common interface for creating objects 
in a superclass, allowing subclasses to change the type of objects being created.
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
<p><b>Singleton:</b> is a generative design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance 
and provides a global access point to it.
</p>
  </li>


<h3>Structural Design Patterns:</h3>

   <li>
<p><b>Bridge:</b> is a structural design pattern that separates one or more classes into two 
separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—allowing code in one class branch to be modified 
independently of the other.
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
<p><b>Facade:</b> is a structural design pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex system 
of classes, libraries, or frameworks.
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
<p><b>Proxy:</b> it is a structural design pattern that allows you to substitute special substitute 
objects for real objects. These objects intercept calls to the original object, allowing you to do 
something before or after the call is passed to the original.
</p>
  </li>


<h3>Behavioral Design Patterns:</h3>

   <li>
<p><b>Chain of Responsibility:</b> is a behavioral design pattern that allows requests to be sent 
sequentially through a chain of handlers. Each subsequent handler decides whether it can handle 
the request itself and whether it should pass the request further down the chain.
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
<p><b>State:</b> is a behavioral design pattern that enables objects to change behavior depending 
on their state. From the outside, the impression is created as if the class of the object has changed.
</p>
  </li>

  <li>
<p><b>Strategy:</b> is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of similar algorithms 
and places each of them in its own class. After that, the algorithms can be replaced one for another 
directly during the execution of the program.
</p>
  </li>

</ul>
